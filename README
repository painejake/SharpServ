== Welcome to SharpServ ==

SharpServ is an Open Source implementation for a web server written
in C# using the Mono framework (.NET 3.5)

The project is designed to learn more about C# and the cross platform
support provided by the Mono Project.

SharpServ should build under any envrionment where Mono and/or .NET is
avaliable.

The idea is to build a web server serving HTML and CSS pages quickly,
without leaving a large footprint behind. Eventually the web server
should support the following features:

	* Multiple listener threads.
	* XML configuration.
	* A plugin 'like' system.

If you would like to contribute to the project please fork and show
your changes or contact me via GitHub messenger.
